# CoffeeShop
CoffeeShop is a mobile-based study app that emulates the experience of working with other people. Built with React Native & Firebase.

## Features
- Anonymous sign-on to study rooms, which are capped to create a more intimate setting
- A phone usage bar to disincentivize the use of other apps during a study session
- Coffee shop sounds that adjust in volume to simulate the sound difference based on the # of people present
